# generator-hmlad [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hurrymaplelad/generator-hmlad.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hurrymaplelad/generator-hmlad)

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for NPM packages following my personal conventions


## Getting Started

You need Yeoman:
```
$ npm install -g yo
```

generator-hmlad isn't published to NPM, since it's just for me.  Point at the URL instead:

```
$ npm install -g git+https://github.com/hurrymaplelad/generator-hmlad
```

Or even better, checkout and link the repo to quickly fix things that don't work right:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hurrymaplelad/generator-hmlad.git
$ cd generator-hmlad && npm link
```

Then you can start a new node module with:
```
$ yo hmlad
```
